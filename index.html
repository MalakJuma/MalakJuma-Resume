        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a Palestinian/American 18 year old that currently goes to UCR to get a bachelors in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing. I have 4 Associate degrees that I got at the age of 17. And my goal in life is to open my own modest fashion store that I can make a living out of. As an Arab/American girl, one of my dreams is that one day I hope my designs will be part of a runway. I currently draw dress designs so one day when I open my own store I will actually start designing them and selling them. The only experience that I have is that I designed jackets before for the Avid club at my high school and so many complemented the design that I created. I first found out that I have a true passion and love for fashion during Covid and I really want to design clothes that are modest for my Muslim sisters or modest sisters in general. Because living in the west can be hard to find modest clothing that is stylish and doesn't look like it is for old people. And the reason why I want to concentrate in marketing is because I think that is an important skill to learn in order to run a business. In this generation if you want to catch peoples eye so they can buy from your business is having good advertising. My main goal in college is to learn the skills that I will need to be successful in managing my own business and also build connections with other people at school because communication is also key to a business. I have been trying to build my social media platform so one one day I can have thousands of followers where I can advertise my pieces and designs and people will hopefully follow me and buy my designs. And I know I will be able to get to where I want to be thanks to the scholarship money I got and the supportiveness I have from my family and friends. Because they push me everyday to work hard and do my best, they believe in me so much, even more than I believe in myself, and I am really thankful for that. I wouldn't be where I am today, going to college to get my bachelors hopefully at the age of 20. I couldnâ€™t be more grateful and I can't wait to see where my path takes me in life.<br><br>
